Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Packages: All files will share the Python packages `chyp`, `hypergraphx`, and `polars` as dependencies. These packages will be imported in each file as needed.

2. Data Schemas: The data schemas for `Energy`, `Services`, and `Compute` will be shared across the `energy_marketplace.py`, `services.py`, and `compute.py` files. These schemas will define the structure of the data being exchanged in the marketplace.

3. Function Names: Functions such as `exchange_energy()`, `exchange_services()`, `exchange_compute()`, `visualize_hypergraph()`, and `generate_string_diagram()` will be shared across multiple files. These functions will be defined in their respective files and imported as needed.

4. Hypergraph: The `Hypergraph` class from `hypergraph.py` will be shared across `main.py`, `energy_marketplace.py`, `services.py`, `compute.py`, and `visualization.py` for the creation and manipulation of the hypergraph.

5. String Diagrams: The `StringDiagram` class from `string_diagrams.py` will be shared across `main.py`, `energy_marketplace.py`, `services.py`, `compute.py`, and `visualization.py` for the visualization of the hypergraph.

6. Test Cases: The test cases defined in the `tests` directory will share the `unittest` Python package as a dependency. They will also share the `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods for setting up and cleaning up the test environment.

7. Requirements.txt: This file will list all the shared dependencies for the project, including the Python packages `chyp`, `hypergraphx`, and `polars`.

8. Message Names: Message names such as `EXCHANGE_SUCCESS`, `EXCHANGE_FAILURE`, `VISUALIZATION_SUCCESS`, and `VISUALIZATION_FAILURE` will be shared across multiple files to standardize communication and error handling.
