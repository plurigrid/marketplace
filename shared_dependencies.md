Shared Dependencies:

1. Imported Libraries: All files will share the imported libraries 'chyp', 'hypergraphx', and 'polars' from pip. 

2. Data Schemas: The data schemas for energy, services, and compute credits will be shared across the marketplace files (energy_marketplace.py, services_marketplace.py, compute_marketplace.py).

3. Function Names: Functions for creating, updating, and deleting credits will be shared across the marketplace files. Functions for visualizing the hypergraph and string diagrams will be shared in hypergraph_visualization.py and string_diagrams.py.

4. Message Names: Message names for successful transactions, errors, and updates will be shared across all files.

5. Utility Functions: Utility functions for data validation, error handling, and other common tasks will be shared in utils.py.

6. Constants: Constants like the marketplace names, credit types, and other configuration values will be shared across all files.

7. Variables: Variables for the current state of the marketplaces, the hypergraph, and the string diagrams will be shared across all files.

Note: As this is a Python project, there are no DOM elements for JavaScript functions.
